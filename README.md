# debian-client-nft-ruleset
A small (strict) ruleset useful for a debian network client / server. The machine consumes an NTP service, an APT service, and a DNS service. This ruleset could be augmented by a cron job to (periodically) query addresses of names such as 'deb.debian.org' and 'pool.ntp.org'.
